Since the age of nine, she used to entertain her classmates by mimicking all the popular artists of both Amharic and English music by using her lunch box as a drum. Her passion and love for music were nourished by her father, Dejazmach Sebsibe Shiberu's jam sessions at their home and his musical, peptic background. She lived in Washington, DC, United States for many years but moved back to Ethiopia c. 2003."

        "description": "The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo church is one of the oldest and apostolic churches present today. It is bathed in a rich heritage of beautiful worship, heavenly hymns and poetry. As it was wisely put by His Holiness Pope Shenouda (the late patriarch of our sister church, the Egyptian Orthodox Church) \"A church without youth is a church without a future.\" And one youth once replied to H. H., \"And youth without the church are youth without a future.\" And we refuse to be a generation that passively let its future come to an end!\n\n\nWe aim to spread the teachings & worship of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo faith in English and grow in our relationship with the Lord our savior and our GOD Jesus Christ."
